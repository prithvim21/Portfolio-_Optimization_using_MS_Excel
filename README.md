# Portfolio-_Optimization_using_MS_Excel
This project focused on optimizing a portfolio consisting of Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, ITC, Infosys, and Reliance Industries Ltd. using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to maximize returns while managing risk by applying modern portfolio theory to two years of historical stock data.

Daily price data was collected and used to calculate expected returns, variances, and covariances for each stock. From these, a correlation matrix and risk-return profiles were developed to understand how each stock interacted within the portfolio. Using Excelâ€™s Solver tool, optimal weight allocations were determined to either minimize portfolio risk for a target return or maximize return for a given risk level.

Multiple scenarios were tested, such as limiting exposure to a single stock and disallowing short selling. Visualizations, including an efficient frontier, were created to help evaluate trade-offs between risk and return, supporting better investment decision-making.
